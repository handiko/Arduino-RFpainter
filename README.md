# Arduino RFpainter - Abusing FMCW to Paint on Your Spectrogram
A few years ago, a guy who own github username [drmpeg](https://github.com/drmpeg) wrote a nice gnuradio block which is called [gr-painter](https://github.com/drmpeg/gr-paint). This block works very well and I had some fun with it. Now, I don't have SDR which can transmit anymore, only receive (an el-cheapo RTL SDR dongle) and I want to have do that again, so, I can't. I have some AD9851 DDS modules lying araund, so I decided to implement FMCW version of gr-painter (because I can't figure out how to implement OFDM on DDS module, yet). It won't be as good as gr-painter (which is using OFDM) but i good enough for me.
